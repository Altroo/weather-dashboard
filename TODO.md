# Project Brief
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a responsive weather dashboard application that demonstrates UI implementation skills and API integration.

## Technical Requirements
The following technical requirements must be met:
* Develop the application using React (additional libraries/frameworks at candidate's discretion)
* Create responsive designs that work across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
* Implement API integration with OpenWeatherMap or similar public, no-auth API
* Handle API errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
* Implement proper state management

## Required Features
The application must include the following features:
* Current weather display with relevant metrics
* 5-day forecast with visual representations
* Location search functionality
* Toggle between metric/imperial units
* Loading states and error handling

## Evaluation Criteria
The application will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
* Code organization and component structure
* UI implementation matching provided design mockups
* Responsive design implementation
* API integration and error handling
* Performance considerations
* Documentation quality

## Deliverables
The following deliverables are expected:
* A GitHub repository containing the complete source code
* A README with setup instructions and notes on implementation decisions
* A brief explanation of where AI tools were used (if applicable)

## Time Limit
There is no time limit for this project, but it is recommended to complete it within a few hours.
